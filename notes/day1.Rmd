knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(here)
here::here()
```

## Preamble

**packages**
  * having issues? shutdown RStudio and try in just R

**lintr** package
  * checks for tidy code
  * will flag spaces, double quotes, etc.
  * load, find under 'Addins'
  
## Version Control
* save space with different versions esp when collaborating

### Git
* not the only versioning system - subversion (git is better)
* distributed (doesn't live in one spot) version control system
  * distributed because collaboration is so important
  * developed for linux kernel
* stores snapshots of the file system - **commits**
* system consists of three trees:
  * Workspace
  * Staging Area
  * Local Repository 
    ** keeps track of parent file and differences
    `r knitr::include_graphics(here("./pictures/git_spaces.png"))`

Files can be in one of four states:
  1. untracked 
  2. staged
  3. committed
  4. modified
* local repository
* remote repository - like GitHub

#### Test Repo
* Deleting a git repo is just deleting the .git folder
* .git folder holds the other two trees 'staging' and 'local repo'
* .gitignore file is the *blacklist*
  * Don't include passwords etc '.Ruserdata'
  * Don't commit data
* commit - compares 'hash' 'sharcode' between codes
  * First 7 characters of the hash is unique 
  * Commit early and often
* Tags
  * Command line or gert
  * Git tag -a <tag> -m <message> e.g. "V1 "Version 1"
  * gert::git_tag_create(name = "V1", message = "Version 1")
  * **no special characters in tags**

Rolling back to a previous commit:

1. Checkout
  * go back to previous commit - *detached head*
    * bit more convoluted with commands
    * gert::git_branch_create(branch='temp', ref='', checkout=T)
    * use a temporary branch
    * checkout=T - go back to that commit
  * git checkout #
  * go back to current
    * git checkout master OR tag-V1 OR shar
    * gert::git_branch_checkout(branch = 'master')
2. Reset
  * reset at prior commit - like it never happened (accidentally commited passwords, credentials, etc.)
  * dramatic - can mess up collaboration
3. Revert
  * reverse - do the inverse
  * not built into RStudio
  * git revert HEAD --no-edit 
    * OR tag OR shar
    * don't need message because you get one
    
#### Branching
Create a new branch for some experimental coding.

**Merging** drags a branch to master (must be on master)

* git merge <Name>
* git merge Experimental 
* manually fix conflicts between 'fences'
* commit with message

### GitHub

1. Step 1: get a github account and verify email address
2. Step 2: create one or more Personal Access Tokens (PAT). Passwords give full access PATs can be more personalized with read/write access, just read access, etc. Can create PATs in GitHub or from RStudio.
  * usethis::create_github_token()
    * Send to GitHub, tick write access, etc.
  * gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
    * Paste in PAT sharcode
  * Check if you have token:
    * gitcreds::gitcreds_get()
  * Copied credentials to computer wallet/keychain. The machine itself communicating with GitHub. Would need separate one for BitBucket, GitLab, etc. Usually use a different one for different machines.
3. Step 3: create a remote repository on GitHub
  * If not using use_github()
  * git remote add origin https://github.com/seaCatKim/Test.git
  * 
  * using gert - did not work
    * gert::git_remote_add(url='https://github.com/seaCatKim/Test.git')
    * gert::git_remote_list()
  * Public - word search findable. Get access to GitHub pages.
  * Don't click README or other options to get Quick set up page
4. Step 4: push/pull from remote to local repository


```{r }
```

### Reproducibility

1. Version control code
2. Pre-registering intentions
